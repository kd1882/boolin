## Making boolean search strings possible for those who can't

### Why?
Quick, easy, down and dirty webApp that will take a search string and output a properly formatted boolean search strings.

### ...Why?
While not unique nor extraordinary, it's a good project for myself to work with session, api's, and eventually building in authentication and running it on a local server.

### What's the end state?
Utilizing a simple webApp gui built off flask and bootstrap, tying in NLP (Unsure of model at this time), extract synonyms and format them properly. As this progress maybe move towards a live operator suggestion panel which'll show different variations of the search string.

### When can we expect something besides hardcoded synonyms?
Depends, but as of right now this app is pretty good at finding dog parks near Massachusets, Boston, Worcester, Cambridge, Springfield, or Lowell...
